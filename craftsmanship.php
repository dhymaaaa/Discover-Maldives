            <p>“Kissaru Wadaan”; this is the Maldives way of building a boat, this unique approach of construction of boats was invented in the Maldives centuries back. During the early days, palm trees were used as timber to build a boat, no automatic tools were used, and only hand-crafted tools were used in those days. However, along with the development took place, the boat building industry in the Maldives took a turn to modernize the work method, now carpenters use automatic tools to work. Despite the automation, the skill that inherited from our forefathers brings the boats that we see in the Maldives water into existence.</p>

                    <p>Lacquer work is locally known as liyelaa jehun or laa jehun. Maldives had trade connections with China even during ancient times, and it is believed that liyelaa jehun is a craft that Maldivians inherited from the Chinese. Although now Maldivian lacquer works appear to be solely produced for decorative purposes, lacquer was first used in the country for the simple purpose of increasing the durability of wooden products. Maldivian lacquer artists use imported lacquer and color. First the lacquer is heated, colored, and hammered, so that it becomes soft. Then it is stretched to form strips. Wooden blocks from local trees such as Funa or the Alexander Laurel wood tree, are shaped to the desired form by using a lathe. When the desired shape has been achieved, the lacquer strips are applied to it. The lacquer layers are then polished using dried coconut palm leaves. When the layers are complete, the object is sawn off at the base to remove it from the unshaped portion of the wood. Then, designs are hand etched on them. Since the lacquer is applied in layers, one over the other, when the outer layer is etched, the inner colors become visible. Traditional Maldivian lacquer works feature three colors: red, yellow and black.</p>

                        <h2>Kasabu Viyun</h2>
                    </section>
                    <section class="text-bloc">
                        <p>Kasabu boavalhu is the elaborate neckline of the Maldivian traditional dress <i>dhivehi libaas</i>. The embroidery technique used for making this neckline is called <i>kasabu viyun</i>. Kasabu boavalhu is made from imported cotton, silk and metallic threads. Vivid colours such as greens, reds and blues are used along with silver and gold. A special set of equipment is used to make the kasabu boavalhu. <i>Gathaa fai</i> is the base structure. It is made from wood in the shape of a short vase. On top of the hollow base is the gathaafaige boa, a round cushion made from cloth which is used to pin threads. The five inch long <i>foalibai</i> function as the weights that hold the threads. Since heavy ones are preferred, they are often made from sturdy wood or fishbone. Up to 34 of these can be used at one time. Using this set of equipment, ribbons are woven. There are three types of ribbon—<i>hiru</i>, <i>bagiyaa</i> and <i>rodhigandu</i>. <i>Rodhigandu</i> is the most elaborate of the three. Once the ribbons are prepared, they are hand stitched onto the neckline. The neckline has to be at least four inches wide, and the ribbons have to be placed in a specific order.</p>

                            <h2>Thundu kunaa Viyun</h2>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <p>Thundu kunaa is a hand-woven mat. The mat is made from a local reed <i>haa</i> or <i>khau</i> in the southern dialect. The reeds are plucked, cleaned and sun dried. It takes around 4 days to completely dry. Then the reeds are dyed. The typical colors seen on the thundu kunaa mat are black, yellowish orange, brown and the natural reed color. Locally found roots, leaves and fermented coconut water are used for dying the reeds. The bark of the sea hibiscus tree locally known as <i>dhigga</i> is used for making the thread. The mat is woven by using a horizontal wooden loom that is about the size of a single bed. The loom is created by the island’s carpenters. Since it takes up so much space, the ladies who make thundu kunaa often have a dedicated space for weaving outside of their homes.</p>
